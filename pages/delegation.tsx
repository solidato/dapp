        <AlertTitle>Delegation Information</AlertTitle>
        Delegating your voting power to someone else means that they can vote on resolutions using your voting power.
        <br />
        This is a useful tool if you are going offline for some time (e.g. long holidays) or you want to become a
        passive DAO member. <br />
        <br />
        However, you need to bear in mind the following features of delegations: <br />
        a) delegation applies only to resolutions that are announced after you have delegated your voting power
        (delegation does not apply to votings that have already be announced by that time);
        <br />
        b) the person you delegated to can vote however he/she chooses, without needing your consent for each vote;
        <br />
        c) if the person you have delegated to, is excluded from a specific voting, your delegation is neglected;
        <br />
        d) if the person you have delegated to looses its voting rights, your delegation is neglected;
        <br />
        e) you can always vote and your vote overrules any delegated voting on your behalf;
        <br />
        f) delegation applies to all the votings that are announced before the cancellation of the delegation
        (delegation is in force with respect of votings announced before the cancellation of the delegation);
        <br />
        g) if you fail to vote in the adoption of at least 51% of the resolutions of the calendar year (resolutions
        submitted in a negative manner shall not be taken into account), you be suspended from voting rights for an
        indefinite term by a resolution of the shareholders.
